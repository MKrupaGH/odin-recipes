    <h3>Meal description</h3>
    <p>It is a great meal for vegetarians with huge amount of protein. But the most <br> important is the fact of easy
        preparation and low costs of products</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cans tuna in water, drained</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>¾ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons finely diced celery</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil, divided, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine tuna, eggs, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, celery, lemon juice, seafood seasoning, mustard, pepper,
            and dill in a bowl; stir gently until fully and evenly combined. Shape mixture into 4 patties.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is hot, gently lay 2 tuna patties into the
            skillet. Don't over crowd - only add as many patties as comfortably fit with room to flip them.</li>
        <li>Cook tuna patties until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side, adjusting the heat as needed if they're
            cooking too quickly. Repeat with remaining patties, adding remaining oil as needed.</li>
    </ol>
